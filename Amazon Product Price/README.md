The project will obtain the objective of the project by asking 3 main questions as well as other relevant questions. To reach the goal the following goal, I have to retrieve the files from kaggle, do a lot of data cleaning, doing Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data visualization in the following order.  

## Data Sources

Amazon Product Sales: I used the amazon data files from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lokeshparab/amazon-products-dataset/data

## Tools

- Python - Pandas, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization

- Collect files from Kaggles
- Merging all the files into one dataframe
### 2. Data Cleaning/Adding Columns

- EDA involing exploring the amazon sales and answer question like, what are the top 5 most expensive item listed on Amazon?, most common price range listed?, popular brands?, etc.
- After answering these questions, most of the question will be presented in Visualization format (Matplotlib.pyplot, iplot, and Seaborn)
### 4. Insights and Conclusion
After I finished analyzing and visualizing the dataset, I give my insight on the results of the analysis that seems important and answering the questions from the objective
