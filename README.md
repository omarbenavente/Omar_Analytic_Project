# Omar Benavente Jr. Portfolio

## About Me

Hello everyone! My name is Omar Benavente Jr., and I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Analytics at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematical Sciences with a concentration in Applied Mathematics from the New Jersey Institute of Technology (Spring 2023).

I’m passionate about uncovering insights through data and using analytical methods to solve real-world problems. I’m proficient in Microsoft Excel, Python, SQL, and Tableau, and I enjoy applying these tools to perform data analysis, build visualizations, and communicate meaningful findings.

After completing my undergraduate degree, I deepened my knowledge through several Udemy courses, including:
	•	Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp by Jose Portilla
	•	The Complete SQL Bootcamp: Go from Zero to Hero by Jose Portilla
	•	Microsoft Excel: Data Analysis with Pivot Tables by Mavin Analytics and Chris Dutton

These courses strengthened my technical foundation and analytical problem-solving skills, preparing me for advanced study and practical data-driven work.
