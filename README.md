# Omar Benavente Jr. Portfolio

## About Me

Hello amazing people, my name is Omar Benavente Jr. I'm a recent New Jersey Institute of Technology graduate (Spring 2023) with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Science with a concentration in Applied Mathematics, and I am currently looking to work as a Data Analyst. Proficient in Microsoft Excel, Python, SQL, and Tableau. Throughout my college life I have gained an interest on knowledge on Calculus and Statistics. It wasn't until after graduation that I had a growing passion for using data to create beautiful Analysis and Visualization. I am looking forward to bringing my technical and analytical skills as an entry-level Data Analyst.

After Graduation, I've taken lots of Udemy Courses such as Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp by Jose Portilla, The Complete SQL Bootcamp: Go from Zero to Hero by Jose Portilla, Microsoft Excel: Data Analysis with Excel Pivot Tables by Mavin Analytics, Chris Dutton, and many more. I learned how to make meaningful data visualizations, and impactful data analytics Q&A, and improved my skills in Excel, Python, SQL, and Tableau.

In my free time, I like to go on long walks around my town.  I also love playing Nintendo video games, particularly Super Smash Bros Ultimate.  Funny enough, I go to Smash Bros tournaments from time to time, and I managed to rank #85 best player in New Jersey according to Twitter. 

## About the Portfolio

In this Portfolio, I have included data analytic projects to showcase my data analytical skills, technical skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. My work includes programming languages such as Python, SQL, and Tableau. In my projects, I also ask relevant questions about the data and answer them with my technical and critical-thinking skills.

I am looking forward to using my data analytical and technical skills to land a job as a Data Analyst as well as being an asset to the company that hires me.

Thank you for your time and reach out to me by email or LinkedIn.
