# Nintendo Switch Games Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes data on Nintendo Switch games released between March 2017 (the console’s launch) and September 2022.
The dataset includes information such as developers, publishers, user votes, genres, and release dates, providing valuable insights into Nintendo Switch’s game library.

For this project, I used Microsoft Excel to perform all data cleaning, analysis, and visualization tasks.
This project highlights my skills in data cleaning, Pivot Tables, and dashboard creation using Excel.

You can view the interactive dashboard in the Excel file: "nintendo - switch-games.xslx"

## Steps for this Project

### 1. Gather and Clean the file
- Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.
- Cleaned the data using Power Query:
  - Converted the Release Date column from string to date format by removing unnecessary text.
  - Removed extra spaces in the Review columns to correctly convert them from text to numeric values.
  - Replaced missing values in the Publisher and Developer columns with "Unknown".
  - Removed unnecessary columns that did not provide useful information.
  - Loaded the cleaned data back into Excel for analysis and visualization.

### 2. Data Visualization
- Created Pivot Tables to summarize and explore key metrics.
- Performed a release date frequency analysis to identify patterns, such as which months had the most game releases each year.
- Conducted publisher and developer analyses to highlight the most active contributors in the Nintendo Switch game library.
- Analyzed game popularity and ratings to determine the highest-rated and most well-received titles.
